## Name Origin
**I named it Brass because I originally wanted Zephyr, but there were some conflicts. So Brass was picked because of New Orleans, my hometown, having a love for jazz, many jazz instruments are made with *Brass***

## File Extensions
Source Code: *.bs (Brass Source)

## Design

## Syntax
The full syntax can be found [here][syntax_link]

## Installation (TBD)
Brass is currently in development and cannot be installed

## Usage (TBD)

## Examples
Examples can also be found in the [syntax file][syntax_link]

## Contributing (TBD)
Zephyr is in development at the moment, the only contributions would be telling me about design issues
