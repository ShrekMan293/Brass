## Name Origin
**I named it Zephyr with two reasons in mind:**
1. A zephyr is a light wind, I don't want this to be a big heavy language:: I want it to be lightweight and pretty easy to use
2. Also a tribute to my hometown: New Orleans, New Orleans used to have a baseball team named the Zephyrs, hence Zephyr

## Design
While I was originally inspired by C#, [one amazing design][design_link] made me reconsider, so now the language is based on Rust, Go, and Zig, with a hint of C#

## Syntax
The full syntax can be found [here][syntax_link]

## Installation (TBD)
Zephyr is currently in development and cannot be installed

## Usage (TBD)
Zephyr is currently in development and cannnot be installed

## Examples
Examples can also be found in the [syntax file][syntax_link]

## Contributing (TBD)
Zephyr is in development at the moment, the only contributions would be telling me about design issues
