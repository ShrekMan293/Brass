# Zephyr
A statically typed language that I hope can be a long term project that is updated constantly

### Name Origin
I named it Zephyr with two reasons in mind:
1. A zephyr is a light wind, I don't want this to be a big heavy language. I want it to be lightweight
2. Also a tribute to my hometown: New Orleans, New Orleans used to have a baseball team named the Zephyrs, hence Zephyr
